# No Splash Videos - Skip Splash Screen

Removes the splash videos in Mount &amp; Blade II Bannerlord

There are two versions:
* A mod version, which requires [Harmony](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2006) and must be activated in the launcher
* A file version, which overwrites the splash videos with empty videos

If you use Harmony, install the mod version. Otherwise, install the file version.

## Installation

Install with any mod manager.

Requires [Harmony](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2006) if using the mod version.

### Manual installation

Manually install by extracting into the "Modules" folder under your M&B II game folder, e.g.:

`C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules`

If you're prompted to overwrite files, say yes.
